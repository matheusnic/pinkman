        </h2>
        <p class="descricao-meta">"Yo, so I checked out this flick called Napoleon Dynamite. Dude's like, the biggest nerd ever, right? But in the funniest way possible. Him and his buddy Pedro, they're a total pair. And that chick, Deb, she's kinda crazy, but deep down she's alright. Their school is a total dump, but the people there are wild, you know? Like a bunch of weirdos. Check it out, man, it's a pretty chill movie, you can get some good laughs. Worth a watch."</p>
